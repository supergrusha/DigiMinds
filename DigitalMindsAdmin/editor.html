                            </p>
                            <p>"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe they're like the Orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes through a meat stage."

                            </p>
                            <p>"Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several of their life spans, which didn't take too long. Do you have any idea the life span of meat?"

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like the Weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside."

                            </p>
                            <p>"Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the Weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way through."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"No brain?"

                            </p>
                            <p>"Oh, there is a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made out of meat!"

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So... what does the thinking?"

                            </p>
                            <p>"You're not understanding, are you? The brain does the thinking. The meat."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!"

                            </p>
                            <p>"Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The meat is the whole deal! Are you getting the picture?"

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat."

                            </p>
                            <p>"Finally, Yes. They are indeed made out meat. And they've been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what does the meat have in mind."

                            </p>
                            <p>"First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information. The usual."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're supposed to talk to meat?"

                            </p>
                            <p>"That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio. 'Hello. Anyone out there? Anyone home?' That sort of thing."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?"

                            </p>
                            <p>"Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you just told me they used radio."

                            </p>
                            <p>"They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you advise?"

                            </p>
                            <p>"Officially or unofficially?"

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Both."

                            </p>
                            <p>"Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without prejudice, fear, or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was hoping you would say that."

                            </p>
                            <p>"It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact with meat?"

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say?" `Hello, meat. How's it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with here?"

                            </p>
                            <p>"Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, but they can't live on them. And being meat, they only travel through C space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we just pretend there's no one home in the universe."

                            </p>
                            <p>"That's it."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you have probed? You're sure they won't remember?"

                            </p>
                            <p>"They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat's dream."

                            </p>
                            <p>"And we can marked this sector unoccupied."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Agreed, officially and unofficially. Case closed. Any others? Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?"

                            </p>
                            <p>"Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in G445 zone. Was in contact two galactic rotation ago, wants to be friendly again."

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"They always come around."

                            </p>
                            <p>"And why not? Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone."
